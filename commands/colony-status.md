# Task Status

Show detailed status for a colony project.

## Step 1: Find Project

If $ARGUMENTS specifies a project, use that.

Otherwise, check for projects:
```bash
ls -d .working/colony/*/ 2>/dev/null
```

- One project → show that project's status
- Multiple projects → ask which one (or suggest `/colony-projects` for overview)
- No projects → "No projects found. Use /colony-mobilize to create one."

## Step 2: Load State

```
Read: .working/colony/{project}/state.json
```

## Step 3: Display Status

```markdown
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
